# Minimum_Spanning_Tree

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted (un)directed graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

In this project, we use this data structure to take in a query interval and match it with all the intervals in a pre-set graph and output all the intervals that contain the query interval.

Algorithms implemented: 
Tarjan and Cheriton's round-robin algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of weighted undirected graphs.
